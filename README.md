# To_do_list


## Getting Started

This is a simple Python-based to-do list application that allows users to add, view, and remove tasks directly from the command line.


### Installing

1. Run the following command to clone the project repository to your computer:

```
git pull <https://github.com/reemah-psj/to_do_list.git>
```

2. If you haven't cloned the repository before, you can also use git clone to download the project for the first time

```
git clone <https://github.com/reemah-psj/to_do_list.git>
```

#### Run the Program

```
python todo_list.py
```

##### Removing the Program from your PC

1. Delete the Folder: If you want to delete the to-do list program from your computer, simply delete the folder where the project was cloned.

2. Untrack via Git: If you are working with Git and want to remove your local repository while keeping the remote one intact, you can also manually delete the folder where the project resides or use the following:

```
rm -rf <project_folder>
```

This command will completely remove the folder and its contents from your local machine.
